### Next Steps

- [x] fix blank canvas issue
- [x] fix waveform re-rendering issues
- [ ] position waveform with canvas line on top
  - [ ] use WaveSurfer for waveform handling?
  - [ ] or manually draw waveform in canvas for most control over "layers"...can draw line after drawing canvas so it is on top
- [ ] horizontally scroll the waveform within the canvas container
- [ ] implement a zoom that keeps the line & its points correctly positioned on the waveform
- [ ] make the points on the line click-and-draggable
- [ ] implement a Save button to save progress as you edit the points on the line
